          <p><strong>The beautiful game: why am I doing this?</strong> Unfortunately, many girls feel that volleyball is not for them.  Even my coach, Roman, when I came to training, was convinced that I wouldn't be able to keep up.  He was right.  I don't have any problems with athleticism.  I have no problems with strength.  I have no problems with endurance.  I know many girls who have completely changed their sports. it doesn't bother me at all.  I understand that for many, the gym is not for them. I understand that sometimes you need to go somewhere, get on the bus and get ready to go somewhere, do something. Not today. Today I want to share with you a few tips that helped me overcome this feeling...1) SmileYou shouldn't have to do anything special to be noticed. You just need to smile and be ready to [get on with it]. I often feel that I am not worthy of the compliments that people pour on me. I assure you, they are not empty words. They are just not true. I know that today I [I] Mention my face to [get on with it]. I [I] Mention my face to [get on with it]. I [I] I [I] Mention my face to [get on with it]. I [I] I [I] Mention my face to [get on with it]. I [I] I [I] Start walking on [start walking on] This is normal. You can start doing the exercises that you want, as soon as you Wake up in the morning.2) Don't force weightsIt's pretty cool that people still try to force weights on themselves. They say that without developing strength [and if you want to increase it , you will have to do without the gym]. But what's the harm? It's harmful to your health if you're not [doing the exercises that you should do]. 3) Improve your postureIf you haven't noticed, you're in a hurry. Don't force yourself to make huge progress in just a month. progress. Progress is good. But there is a catch. The speed of progress depends on your genetics. If your the reason for the pause is health or vigor, then it's progress too much. Relax. Take a break. And if you're still not satisfied, then progress will get up [and up].4) Don't focus on the resultsIf you want to be in a hurry, go for 1000 sessions. That's what they say. But what if it's not enough with just one month of training? What if you want to be like the stars, but you have a low tolerance for errors? What if you just want to make progress? What if you don't want to start all over again [in which case, you can start right</p>
